This application installs code in a mostly unused location in flash
ROM which is activated when there is linkport activity. When activated
the code will silently copy itself to the other calculator and install
its code and linkport hook.

The software does nothing malicious, it was simply a fun research
project and a demonstration of the undocumented linkport features.
